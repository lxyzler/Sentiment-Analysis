"If this was SUCCESSFULLY done by anyone except a Chinese or Russian, it would probably have been awarded with a Nobel Prize."
"Oh God, what a nightmare - safe from HIV? How evil. Who could do such a thing "
This is one of those discoveries that has great potential for both good and ill.
 Interesting to know that China has ethics standard. This guy will be taken in by the Chinese government for further experiments.
A huge positive breakthrough in medical science
Now one person has found a way to do it more modified humans will be born under secret control.
Might be cruel but they need terminated
It's if for the benefits of the human race why not
I believe he has committed academic fraud.
I see more negative than positive.
"Last thing Big pharma wants,are cures for illnesses."
 Unintended consequences will result
"God playing, oh I am not sure that is good."
I don't believe this is new or exclusive to China.
"CRISPR technology has been around for a while now, gene editing is not something new."
As a ChineseÔºåI feel very ashamed ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ These guys has no bottom line‚Ä¶
 All this fuss over some designer denim for infants ? 
 The beginning of the zombie apocalypse Manage
Genetic modification is not a bad thing. Fear of science and progress is.
Frankenstein! Just practice safer sex?
 I'm OK with this if it doesn't cause one bad parent to say this baby ain't mine coz of altered DNA.
Maybe they should introduce ethics into their food consumption as well 
Can he alter the genes to stop stupidity!!!
 And big pharma stopped it again Manage
This is how we get super villains.
When will these baby obsessions stop? From eating baby fetuses to editing baby genes. Shocking.
Did the couple ‚Äúkeep‚Äù the babies or abort?
 I think that is a great achievement.Manage
" ""But they seem to hunger for human flesh...meh, we will get the bugs worked out."""
Slippery slope and we are sliding full speed down
 It is a very successful work.It should be allowed for use.
Please stop violence against women... and make humain being count!
 It‚Äôs clear they want more diseases n death than cure
How will BIG PHARMACY survive if there are no diseases or ailments...whom really benefit$ from us not making great medical advances??
"Designer babies, what's next? To early to tell. Stay tuned."
"""customize your character"" but real"
I liked David Suzuki's idea about growing a finger on your upper lip so you can pick your nose and leave your hands free.
Wasn‚Äôt this done by a nazis doctor?
"Designer babies are terrible ideas, fine. But editing out genes like Huntington's disease is a moral necessity and any opposition towards that part of this idea is impeding progress"
"Except that we dont know what long term effects editing out genes has on people. Doing something that could potentially alter the human race is not a moral obligation, nor is it impeding any kind of progress."
It could ONLY alter it for the better. There are no consequences for pulling genes that are only harmful. And letting people die of preventable diseases IS impeding progress.
"Pulling genes out of the genetic code causes a mutation in that genetic code, how can you say with certainty that there are no consequences to that man made genetic mutation?"
"Even if it does happen to a few individuals, it is undeniably worth it if we have even a 10% chance of fixing the problem. Besides, if we'd actually fund the research, maybe solutions could be found to actually replace the genes for Huntington disease with a healthy allele."
"So no genetically engineered catgirls for now, is that what you are saying?"
Editing your way to perfection is unattainable.
They'll shove GMOs down my throat with no label but ask for a baby with Gucci logo skin and suddenly I'm irresponsible.
In other words: ‚ÄúWe re still trying to find out if it actually works and how we can take advantage of this so we have to say it doesnt work for now‚Äù
"because people are never 'irresponsible,' this is a useful statement"
My second brain disagrees.
This is Hitlers dream come true
I agree. People should not try to act like 'god' and start messing with things that should not be fiddled with.
Don't make designer babies
The problem is the future of this twin
 They can be as promiscuous as they want.
 How about they stop spreading diseases with vaccines
That‚Äôs great except what genetic mistakes inadvertently created will be passed down for generations.
" u all backlash gene-edit, okay, what China gov should do is stop his work, hope all of you to calm down"
I agree with this if it helps future generations. Needs to be proven first though‚Ä¶
 This is how mad scientists are created
This has been going on for years. Not something new
 Do not stop research you don't know what they will learn
The intention seems good. Give him the go ahead
 Definitely better than plastic surgery Manage
Why not put that knowledge to something like.... a cure for cancer or alzhimers?
 It just moves under ground
This means they'll be weeding out the gay folks at some point
 Not gonna read this unless they confess about Yao Ming
He's gone from dinosaurs to humans. The man doesn't stop
I knew it ! Gene editing . Thats why they all look the same in china !
Now every child these twins have will have the same gene editing.
" If it's possible to do it, someone somewhere will do it. Then we get the Eugenics war."
China will halt nothing lol.
Watch them live to be 150 and never need a flu shot lol
 Because they have made some 'accident' ooooh scaryyy
"Oh, c'mon.....the most interesting reaserch and they are ""stopping""it!!! We all know they will do it quietlyü§ê now and wont share resultsüòí"
"Wait, he made them immune to HIV? That doesn't sound very ""designer"" to me."
There will be some privileges. They will make second Xi so he can rule china forever
Now is time to start creating man's own human
 There's to many Asians lol no more xD Manage
I'm tipping it will go straight into a PLA military research institute and become highly classified. It will continue...
 Great. That s Gods work needs no help for sure. Don't need robots
" ƒ∞ am not surprised, false leaders will never allow anyone but themselves 'to lead', to them the truth is a threat"
 i believe world's superpowers all doing the same.
Inevitable. I can only imagine what the future holds.
Anyone with half a brain might have predicted this negative response. Why not wait and see what becomes of this procedure? This criticism is more political and religious in tone than it should be.
Because fuck longer life spans and no genetic disorders...
"This is a stupid tweet. This is in response to an experiment presented...you know, the actual news story."
"Damn, and here I actually wanted to be a gene edited superhuman."
The consequences are enormous!
 Like we almost believe they are stopping this
 they could edit it and create super army hahaha
I read that entire article wondering why they kept using He's instead of His. Lol
 His proud of what he has done there should be no self satisfaction
Thinking they will actually stop is like thinking Dr. Lewis Dodgson would have in the first movie
"He could have kep quiet, till few super babies start running around for people to believe in CRISPR"
Any form of genetic manipulation is asking for problems.
Very bad. This Mr due to be winner. Este Sr He debe ser felicitado y apoyado para que siga investigando. Est√° haciendo un bien a la humanidad. Ojal√° haga m√°s descubrimientos y terapias que necesitamos.
Only destruction takes place when any act is committed against the nature
"Trying to go backward by stuffing the Genie back in the bottle, Good Luck. Kind of like trying to reverse Global Warming by denying it is happening,"
"This was a interesting thing that has huge potential good and bad,thats progress!"
